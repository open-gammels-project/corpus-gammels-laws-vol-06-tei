<p>Whereas, said new company desires to be distinguished by name from said &#8220;sold out&#8221; company, to consolidate its property, and to extend said line of railroad; therefore,</p>
<p>section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the new company heretofore known as the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway Company, referred to in the preamble of this act, shall be hereafter known by the corporate name of &#8220;The Galveston, Har<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />risburg and San Antonio Railway Company,&#8217; and may alter its seal to conform to its name; provided, that said new company shall be liable to the State of Texas for the debt of said &#8220;sold out&#8221; company, for loans made to the latter company from the special school fund, in the same manner and to the same extent as said &#8220;sold out&#8221; company was liable; and that said change of name shall in no respect impair or affect said liability, or the existing lien or mortgage of the State upon the railroad of said company as security for said loans.

<p>Sec. 2.

<p>Sec. 7.

<p>Sec. 7. That if any person or persons, whose lands and premises may be taken for the uses aforesaid of said railroad, and the said company can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />not agree as to the value thereof, either party may apply to the District Court of the county in which said lands and premises are situated, for the appointment of commissioners, and said court shall thereupon, in va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation or term time, appoint three disinterested freeholders of said coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ty, who shall appoint a time to view the land and premises aforesaid, and hear the owner thereof and the said company, to whom shall be given, by said commissioners, reasonable notice of the time and place of said hearing; and said commissioners, after being first duly sworn, and after hearing the parties, shall determine the amount of compensation, if any, to which the owner of the land and premises shall be entitled, and make return of their proceedings and of their award to the next succeeding term of said court; and said award, if not rejected by said court for cause then shown, shall be entered up as a judgment of said court.

<p>Sec. 8. And in case any of the lands to be taken as aforesaid, shall be owned and held by an infant, insane person, or person subject to any legal disability, the court may appoint a guardian for any party under such disability to appear in person, and who shall give bond with suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient sureties for the proper and faithful execution of his trust, and who shall represent in court the person disqualified as aforesaid, when the same proceedings shall be had in reference to the appraisement of the land and premises to be taken for the use of the company as aforesaid, and with the same effect as already described. The title of the said company to the lands and premises taken by this act shall not be affected or im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />paired by reason of any failure by any guardian to discharge faithfully his trust. In case any party shall have a right to any land for a, term of years, or any interest therein, in possession, reversion or remainder, the value<pb n="690" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="172" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of such estate, less than fee simple, shall be estimated and determined in the manner hereinbefore provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. When it shall be necessary for said company to enter upon any lands and premises which are unoccupied, and of which there is no apparent owner or claimant, or of a person who resides beyond the limits of the State, said company may take and use the same for the purposes aforesaid, and may institute proceedings in the manner described for the purpose of establishing the value thereof, and of acquiring title to the same; but the judge of the court hearing said suit shall determine the kind of notice to be given to such, owner or owners; and he may, in his discretion, appoint an agent or guardian to represent such owner or own<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers in case of his or their incapacity or non-appearance. But in the event that no owner shall appear within five years from the time of open<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing said road across any lands, all claim to damage against said company shall be barred.</p>

No person shall be a director of said company unless he shall be a stockholder thereof, and qualified to vote for directors at the election at which he shall be chosen.</p>
<p>Sec. 11.

And in the event that no owner shall appear within five years from the time of open<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing said railroad across any lands, all claim to damage against said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany shall be barred.</p>

<p>Whereas, The establishment, at an early day, through the State of Texas, of a telegraphic connection between the United States and the adjoining and sister Republic of Mexico, would be of the utmost im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portance for the material interests of both countries; that its operations would bring into immediate contact with our State the largest, richest and most densely settled portion of that Republic, establishing immediate social, commercial and political intercourse between both countries for their common benefit.</p>
<p>Whereas, in a military point of view, such a line constituting a direct inland communication, connecting the extreme western frontier with the seat of the general government, through San Antonio and headquarters of the Military Department of Texas, would be of the greatest importance for strategic and defensive purposes;</p>
<p>Whereas, on the side of the United States, telegraphic facilities<pb n="822" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="304" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>do not extend westward farther than the city of San Antonio, leaving a wide gap between said place and the Rio Grande; that on the Mexican side the telegraph line connecting Vera Cruz, Orizava, Puebla, the city of Mexico, Zacatecas, San Luis, and several other large cities, reaches al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready the town of Saltillo, in the border State of Coahuila; that Mexican telegraph companies, protected and supported by the government, are pushing energetically the completion of their lines, and that they will, in a very short time, reach their frontier on the Rio Grande; that it is of the highest interest for both countries to fill up the gap aforesaid be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tween San Antonio and the western frontier; therefore,</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That H. B. Adams, E. D. L. Wicks, Thomas B. Hunt and James M.

It shall be the duty of the clerk authorized to make original registrations of documents in said county, to make substituted registra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions in the following cases of the destroyed documents; first, in case a document, suitable for registration, had been registered, and the original properly endorsed, showing the previous registration, shall be presented for new registration; second, in case a document had been registered, and an authenticated copy from the record, showing the previous regis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tration, shall be presented for registration. In a case. of either kind the new registration shall include the principal writing and the requisite endorsements. The original filing and registration of the document shall be established by the new registration; and the registered copy may be used as if it were an original document. And it appearing that one record book, pertaining to the office of said clerk, is only impaired by said fire so as to endanger the perpetuity of the record, said clerk, under supervision of the County Court, shall transcribe each document that may be entire in such book, so that all the mutilated documents shall appear in a new book, which shall have legal effect as the original book; but the latter shall be preserved as far as practicable. The clerk shall procure a suitable book and therein transcribe as aforesaid, for such reasonable compensation as may be determined, by agreement, between the County Court and him, or without such agreement, by an order of the District Court, and payment shall be made by the county treasurer.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. In all the cases of such destroyed documents, not embraced in the preceding section, the District Court of said county<pb n="831" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="313" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>shall have jurisdiction to make decrees, which shall be substitutes for such documents. When the State shall be interested in any such docu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment, a motion may be filed by a legal representative of the government, showing the destruction and substance of the document, and when a pri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vate person or persons shall be interested in any such document, a pe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tition may be filed, with like showing of destruction and substance of the document, and in other respects such motion or petition shall be in conformity with usual practice; and on such motion or petition, such other person or persons as may have an adverse interest, with usual excep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions, shall be cited as defendant or defendants, either by personal ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice, or by publication, the latter mode being used without affidavit of cause; and in other respects the procedure shall be as in ordinary suits, except as otherwise provided by this or other law. On the hearing the court may receive any ordinary evidence, and the deposition or testimony of any person including a party, and the legible portions of such mutil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ated records and documents. Any number of documents pertaining to one interest, may be embraced in one suit. The court, without a jury, shall determine matters of fact as well as of law, except when a party shall require a jury for trying some issue or issues of fact. The destruction and substance of any such document being thus ascertained, the court shall make a corresponding decree; and the court shall award the costs according to equity, the plaintiff or plaintiffs being liable therefor, except in litigated cases that may justify charging the whole or part of the costs against some other party or patties; provided, the State shall not be taxed with costs. Any such decree shall confirm the right or rights con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred by the document or documents thus established. When any such document pertained to a class that was, or shall be embraced within the laws providing for registration of documents, the confirming decree shall be registered as the confirmed document was, or should be, and the decree shall have the effect that the document would have had, if it had not been destroyed, and the date of registering the decree shall determine its effect with reference to the laws for registration, unless the confirmed document should have been registered; and when the effect shall be de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />termined by the date of registering, the confirmed document, as such date, may be established in the decree.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. The fees for registering documents, including decrees under this act, shall be at the usual rates for other registrations of documents; but this section does not apply to transcribing as aforesaid.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The books of laws and reports that had been furnished to the clerks of the courts of said county, being parts of the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="832" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="314" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>stroyed articles, the office of the clerk of the District Court of said county shall be furnished with such books in the customary mode.</p>

<p>Whereas, The Houston and Texas Central Railway Company has be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />come the owner, by purchase, of the Washington County Railroad; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the Houston and Texas Central Railway Company and the Washington County Railroad Company are indebted to the State of Texas for sums borrowed from the special school fund; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the Houston and Texas Central Railway Company is desirous to extend the Washington county branch to the city of Austin, as soon as it can be done, and to build its main trunk to Red River in the shortest time possible, and also to build a branch road from some point in Navarro county, so as to strike Red River at such point as will enable said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany to form a connection with any railroad that may be built south<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ward, from Kansas or Missouri, to said river; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the ability of said company to build said main trunk and branch roads would be greatly increased by the consent of the State to exchange the six per cent. bonds of the said companies, now held by the State, for the seven per cent. gold interest-bearing bonds of the said Houston and Texas Central Railway Company, issued by virtue of a deed of trust executed by said company on the first day of July, A. D. 1866, in which deed of trust Shepherd Knapp and David S. Dodge, of the city of New York, are named (and have accepted) as trustees; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, it is believed that such exchange can be made without in any manner endangering the security of the school fund; therefore,</p>

<p>Sec. 3. The said Houston and Texas Central Railway Company is hereby authorized&#8212;any former laws to the contrary notwithstanding&#8212; to build its road through the counties of Limestone and Navarro, on the most eligible route, to be designated by its engineers; provided, that the main trunk of said railway shall pass through the county of Dallas, and to a point on Red River within fifteen-miles of Preston, as is now required by law, and shall be built as fast as the branch.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. No forfeiture of any of the rights or privileges secured to it by existing laws shall be enforced against the said Houston and Texas Cen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tral Railway Company, by reason of its failure to comply with the condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions as to construction, imposed by the first section of the act of the twenty-first of September, A.
