The said marshal, for the more efficient dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge of his duties, may appoint one or more deputies, who shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the marshal has or should perform, the said marshal being responsible for the faithful performance of their duties by his said deputies; and for his services the marshal shall receive the same fees as the sheriff of the county does by law receive for like services, and such other com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensation, if necessary, as the council may deem sufficient.</p>

If such sales should not be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pleted on the day appointed, the assessor and collector may adjourn the sales from day to day until they are all completed.</p>
<p>Sec. 34.

<salute>An Act to encourage the speedy construction of a railway through the State of Texas to the Pacific Ocean.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, The State of Texas has heretofore, at different periods, incorporated three different companies with power to construct a railway from the eastern boundary of the State to El Paso, on the Rio Grande, to wit: the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad Company, and the Southern Trans-Continental Railway Company; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, the object of the State in these several acts of incorpora<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion has ever been to secure the construction through the State of a railway connecting the railway system of the Atlantic States with the Pacific Ocean; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, There is reason to believe that the said Southern Trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />continental Railway Company will succeed by contract to the rights, franchises and property of the said Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad Company; and that the time has come when, by concert of action between all of the said companies, and by the aid of the Government of the United States, the great object of a railway to the Pacific Ocean through the State of Texas may be attained; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The speedy construction of said railway through the State of Texas would greatly enhance the value of the public lands, develop the mineral resources of the State, and give protection and<pb n="1624" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="486" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>security to the frontier by expelling therefrom the bands of hostile Indians by whom the western settlements are now continually scourged; and,</p>
<p>Whereas, These objects warrant and demand the most liberal leg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />islation on the part of the State; therefore.</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That in order to secure and promote the speedy construction of a railway through the State of Texas to the Pacific Ocean, and there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />by secure the incidental advantages of cheap transportation for im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />migrants to the western and unsettled portions of the State, facility of communication between the eastern and western boundaries, the settlement and enhancement in value of the now unoccupied pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic domain, and the development of the great mineral, agricultural and stock raising resources of the State, the State of Texas hereby consents, binds and obligates itself to donate and does hereby grant to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company and to the Southern Trans-Continental Railway Company, heretofore chartered by the Legislature of the State of Texas, the bonds of the State of Texas, to the amount of six millions of dollars, in the manner and upon the terms and conditions following, to-wit: To the Southern Pacific Railroad Company there are hereby granted the bonds of the State to the amount of three millions of dollars, and to the Southern Trans-Continental Railway Company there are hereby granted the bonds of the State to the amount of three millions of dollars, upon the condition that the said companies, within six months after the passage of this act, will agree upon a point of junction of the two roads, which said point of junction shall be west of the longi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tude of the eastern boundary line of Shackleford county, and be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tween the thirty-second and the thirty-third parallels of north lati<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tude, and shall file such agreement, duly executed by the two com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />panies, in the form of an indenture between the two companies, in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Texas. The said the Southern Pacific Railroad Company shall build its road from the present western terminus thereof at Longview, in Upshur county, by the most practicable route to the city of Tyler, in Smith county, so that the said road shall pass within one-half mile of the court house in said city, and from the said city of Tyler the said road shall be built westwardly so as not to depart more than five miles from a due west course until it shall cross the Brazos river, and the said road shall be built from said Brazos river, by the most practicable route, to the point of junction; and the said the Southern Trans-Continental Railway Company shall build its road from Jefferson to a point on the eastern boundary line of the State of Texas bordering on the State of Arkansas, at<pb n="1625" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="487" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>or near Texarcana, and thence to the point of junction, confining its line as nearly as may be practicable to the old survey of the Mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />phis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad Company; the said companies, within twelve months after the passage of this act, shall make a survey of the route of each of the said roads to the said point of junction, and shall file a map of the said routes in the General Land Office at Austin, and in the office of the Secretary of State, and the distance between the principal points along said routes to the said point of junction shall be carefully noted on said map.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The bonds in the foregoing section granted, shall be of the denomination of one thousand dollars each, payable to the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany which may be entitled under the provisions of this act to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceive them, or bearer, in thirty years from the date thereof, with in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest at the rate of eight per centum per annum, payable semi-an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nually, viz: on the first day of January, and the first day of July of each year; said bonds to have coupons attached for each install<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of interest to become due, which said coupons shall be made payable upon presentation at the city of New York, through such agent or agents of the Slate as the Governor of the State may select and appoint to pay the same. The said bonds shall be signed by the Governor and the Treasurer of the State of Texas, shall have the seal of the State affixed to them, and shall be countersigned and registered by the Comptroller of Public Accounts.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. Unless and until adequate means shall be otherwise pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided by law for the payment of the current interest and two per centum as a sinking fund for the redemption of the principal of the bonds that may be issued under the provisions of this act, the Comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller of Public Accounts shall cause to be assessed a tax upon all taxable property, real and personal, in the State, and upon all occu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pations, proportioned to the taxes levied by general law on such property and occupations, sufficient annually to pay the accruing semi-annual interest on the bonds that may be issued under the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of this act, and two per centum as a sinking fund; which said sum shall be assessed and collected and deposited in the Treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ury of the State, subject to the order of the Governor, to meet the payment of the interest coupons and the principal of the said bonds as soon as and whenever the same shall become due; provided, that no greater tax shall be assessed and collected by authority of this section than may be needed from time to time to pay said interest and sinking fund; and provided further, that whenever adequate means shall be otherwise provided by law for the payment of the said interest and sinking fund, this section shall have no further force or effect, nor shah any tax whatever be assessed or collected by authority of this section until the bonds granted by the first sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="1626" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="488" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>tion shall have been issued in accordance with the provisions of the various sections of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. None of the bonds hereinbefore provided for, shall be issued or delivered to either of the said railroad companies until both of the said roads shall be completed to the point of junction fixed in the first section of this act; and upon the completion of both of the said roads to the said point of junction, the whole amount of the bonds hereinbefore granted shall be delivered to the said companies respectively, unless the Legislature of the State shall have substituted for said bonds a grant of the public lands, as here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inafter provided; provided, that before issuing and delivering any of the said bonds to the said companies, or either of them, the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor of the State shall have such evidence as may be satisfactory to him, or such as may be prescribed by law, that both of the said roads have been completed to the said point of junction, and are then open to the use of the public.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Whenever the Legislature of the State shall have power under the Constitution of the State to grant the public lands of the State in aid of internal improvements it shall be competent for the Legislature, (if it shall think proper to do so) to substitute for the bonds hereinbefore granted, a grant of the public lands to each of the said railroad companies, to the amount of twenty-four sections to each of said companies for each mile of road built by the said companies respectively, after the passage of this act, to the said point of junction.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. It the Legislature of the State shall not have substi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tuted a grant of the public lands for the said bonds, as is provided for in the foregoing section, before the said roads shall be completed to the said point of junction, then the said bonds shall be issued and delivered to the said railroad companies as is hereinbefore provided; but upon the fundamental condition, which shall be expressed in the face of said bonds, that the State of Texas shall, at any time before the maturity of said bonds, and when the State shall have the power so to dispose of the public lands, have the right to redeem the said bonds by a grant of the public lands to the holder or holders of said bonds, at the rate of fourteen hundred and forty acres for each bond; and if the State shall, at any time, so redeem the said bonds, there shall be granted and issued to the holder of each bond, upon the surrender of the same to the State, three certificates for lands, two of which shall be for six hundred and forty acres each, and the other for one hundred and sixty acres; and the party receiving the said certificates in lieu of a bond surrendered, shall have the right to locate the same upon any part of the then unappropriated public domain, free from all conditions whatsoever, except the payment of<pb n="1627" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="489" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>such, office fees as may be prescribed by law for the issuance of cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tificates and patents in all other cases.</p>

<p>Sec. 8. The said railroad companies shall take no benefit what<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever under the provisions of this act, but the same shall be null and void unless the said railroad shall be completed to the said point of junction by the first day of January, A. D. 1874.</p>
