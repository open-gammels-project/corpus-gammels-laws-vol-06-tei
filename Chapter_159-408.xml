Where there are two or more defendants in a suit, and one or more are served with process in due time, and others not so served, the plaintiff may either discontinue as to those not so served and proceed against those that are, or he may continue the suit until the next term of the court, and take new process against those not served; and no de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />defendant against whom any suit may be discontinued according to the provisions of this section shall be thereby exonerated from any lia<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bility under which he was, but may at any time be proceeded against as if no such suit had been brought and no such discontinuance entered as to such defendants; provided, that this section shall not be so construed as to allow a plaintiff to discontinue as to the principal, and take judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment against the indorser or surety who is jointly sued. Any justice of the peace, before whom any suit or proceeding is pending, may for good cause shown by either party and supported by affidavit, continue the same to the next term of his court; and if such cause or proceeding is such as can be tried by such justice at any other time than at a regular term, he shall have the like power to continue the same for a reasonable time. When both parties in any suit before a justice of the peace ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear in person or by agent or attorney, at the time appointed for the trial thereof, or at the time to which it may have been continued, if the amount in controversy shall not exceed ten dollars, or if the amount in controversy shall exceed ten dollars, and neither party shall make application to have the cause tried by a jury, the justice shall proceed to hear the allegations and proofs of the parties; and the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="267" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="93" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>fendant, upon giving notice thereof to the plaintiff before the trial com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mences, shall be allowed to present and prove any claim or demand not exceeding one hundred dollars, exclusive of interest, against the plaintiff, that is similar in its character to the claim or demand of the plaintiff; and the suit shall be determined by the justice, as from the testimony shall seem to be right. If it shall appear from the testimony that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judgment shall be entered in his favor for such amount as shall appear to be due him with costs; but if it shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear from the testimony that the defendant is entitled to recover, then judgment shall be entered in his favor of such amount as shall appear to be due him (if any) with costs. If the amount in controversy shall ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed ten dollars, and either party shall make application to have the case tried by a jury, then the same shall be so tried in like manner as here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inbefore provided; and upon the return of the verdict of the jury, the justice shall enter judgment thereon with costs; provided, however, that whenever it shall appear on any such trial that the defendant&#8217;s claim or demand was acquired after the commencement of the plaintiff&#8217;s suit, the defendant shall be liable for all the costs.</p>

<p>4. That there is another suit pending in this State between the same parties for the same cause of action or counter claim.</p>
<p>5. That there is a defect of parties, plaintiff or defendant.</p>
<p>6. That a written instrument, purporting to be signed by him, or by his authority, was not executed by him nor by his authority.</p>
<p>7. That an endorsement or assignment of a written instrument was not made by the party by whom it purports to have been made, nor by his authority.</p>
<p>8. A denial of partnership, whether the same be on the part of the plaintiff or defendant.</p>
<p>In all proceedings before a justice of the peace, in which either party may be entitled to a jury, and shall make application for one, such jury shall be composed of six men; and the justice shall, forth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />with, issue a writ directed to some lawful officer of the county, com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding him to summon forthwith six disinterested freeholders or householders to serve as a jury; and if any person so summoned shall fail or refuse to attend, he may be fined by the justice three<pb n="268" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="94" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>dollars, for the use of the county, for such failure or neglect after being cited to do so. In all trials for criminal offenses, either the person prose<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cuting, or the accused, may challenge two of such jurors without assign<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing any cause therefor; and in all trials, whether civil or criminal, either party may challenge any number of jurors for cause, which cause shall be judged of by the justice. If from challenges, or any other cause, a sufficient number of the jury do not attend, the justice shall order some lawful officer to summon a sufficient number of qualified jurors to make up the jury. When a jury is formed, the justice shall administer to them an oath or affirmation, in form as follows: &#8220;You, and each of you, do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that you will well and truly try the cause about to be submitted to you, and a true verdict give therein, according to the evidence, so help you God.&#8221; Whenever a jury has been formed in a justice&#8217;s court, the same jury may be called on to try all causes before such justice, in which a jury is required, on the same day, without the necessity of a new writ in each case; provided, how<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever, that jurors shall be sworn for each cause. In all cases before jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tices of the peace, other than prosecutions for offenses against the laws of this State, the party applying for a jury shall, before the trial com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mences, pay a jury fee of three dollars, which shall be equally divided between the jurors trying the cause; and if the party paying such fee shall recover judgment, the jury fee shall be taxed in the bill of costs, and when collected shall be refunded to him; and in all trials before a justice of the peace, which shall be tried by a jury, when the jury fee is not required to be paid before the trial commences, a like jury fee shall be taxed in the bill of costs, and when collected shall be equally divided between the jurors who tried the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. In all suits before a justice of the peace, it shall be his duty, on the application of either party, to issue subpoenas for witnesses residing in the county, which subpoenas may be directed to any lawful officer of the county; and all such subpoenas shall be executed by the officer to whom they may be directed, by reading the same to the witness, or leading a copy thereof at his usual place of abode, and shall be returned on or before the time when the witness is required to attend. Justices of the peace shall have power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, and to compel them to give evidence in their courts, by attachment and imprisonment; provided, that in civil cases no witness shall be attached, fined or imprisoned unless he shall have refused to obey a subpoena after having been tendered his fees for one day&#8217;s attend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance. On the trial of any civil suit, before a justice of the peace, if either party shall make oath that he knows of no witness by whom<pb n="269" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="95" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>he can prove a fact that is material to his claim or defense, except him<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />self, the party making such oath shall be examined touching such fact, and either party to any such suit may cause the other party to be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poenaed and examined as a witness. Upon all trials before a justice of the peace, if any exceptions are taken to any deposition or evidence, the same shall be decided by the justice. All witnesses who are sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poenaed to attend a justice&#8217;s court, shall be entitled to receive one dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lar per day for each day&#8217;s attendance, which, if claimed by the witness at the time of trial, shall be taxed in the bill of costs against the party cast in the suit. Whenever in any civil suit, before any justice of the peace, the evidence of a female is required, or the evidence of any wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness residing in the county, who is unable by reason of age, infirmities or sickness, to attend the court, or the evidence of a witness residing out of the county, the party interested may take the deposition of any such witness by filing with the justice before whom such suit is pend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing, interrogatories to such witness, and serving a copy of the same on the opposite party, his agent, or attorney, with a notice that he intends to apply for a commission to take the answers of the witness to such interrogatories; such notice and copy may be served by any lawful officer of the county, or by any other person, but when served by any other person than an officer, an affidavit shall be endorsed on, or annexed to such notice by the person serving the same, stating the fact of the service of such notice and copy of interrogatories, which affidavit, unless disproved, shall be evidence of such service; and the opposite party may file cross-interrogatories with the justice at any time before the commission issues. At the expiration of five days from the service of any such notice and interrogatories, on the application of the party who filed the same, his agent, or attorney, it shall be the duty of the justice to issue a commission, with a copy of the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, if any have been filed, directed to some notary public or clerk of the District Court of the county where such witness resides, requiring such notary public or clerk to take the answers of such witness to the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories that accom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany such commission, to cause the witness to be sworn to his answers, and to subscribe them; and every notary public or clerk of the District Court, to whom any such commissions may be directed, shall execute the same according to the directions therein contained, and for that purpose he shall have like powers as notaries public and clerks of the District Court have to execute commissions, to take depositions when issued from the District Court. He shall certify under his hand and official seal the manner in which he has executed such commission, and seal up such certificate and answer with the commission and interrogatories,<pb n="270" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="96" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>write his name across the seal of the envelope, direct the same to the justice from whom the commission issued, and forward it either by mail or private conveyance. If sent by mail, he shall cause the postmaster, or his deputy, mailing the same, to endorse thereon that he received it from the hands of the officer who took such answers; if sent by private hand, the person delivering the same to the justice shall make an affi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />davit in writing, before such justice, that he received the package from the hands of the officer who took such answers, and that it has under<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gone no change since. All evidence so taken and returned to any jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice&#8217;s court, may be read in evidence on the trial of the suit on which it was taken, and shall have the same force and effect as if the witnesses were examined in open court; provided the answers are responsive to the interrogatories; and provided, also, that the interrogatories and answers shall be subject to all legal exceptions; but when such depositions are filed with the justice before the trial commences, no exceptions shall be heard as to the manner of taking and returning such depositions, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less they are taken before the trial commences. All the rules of evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence prescribed for the government of District Courts, where the same do not conflict with the provisions of this act, shall govern the proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings in the justices&#8217; courts, so far as the same is applicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Any justice may, for a good cause shown, supported by an affidavit in writing, grant a new trial in any civil suit tried before him, whenever he shall consider that justice has not been done in the trial of such case; provided, however, that all applications for a new trial shall be made within ten days after the rendition of judgment, and one day&#8217;s notice of the application shall be given to the opposite party, his agent or attorney; provided, also, that not more than one new trial shall be granted to either party; and in all cases where a new trial shall be granted, the cause shall be continued to the next term of the court. All judgments and final orders, given by any justice of the peace, in any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, shall be given in open court. Any person may appear before any justice of the peace and confess a judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment for any amount within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, without the issuance of any citation; and all such confessions of judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment shall be recorded in like manner as other judgments. When a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant, who has been served with a citation from a justice of the peace, according to law, shall neglect to appear, at or before ten o&#8217;clock, A. M., of the return day of the citation, at or before the same hour of any day to which the cause may have been continued, the justice shall proceed in the following manner: 1. If the plaintiffs cause of action is liquidated, and proved by any instrument in writing, purporting to have been<pb n="271" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="97" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>executed by the defendant, the justice shall, whether the plaintiff ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear or not, after allowing the proper credits for all payments endorsed on such instrument in writing, render judgment by default, against the defendant, for the amount which shall appear by such instrument in writing to be due to the plaintiff, together with the costs of suit. 2. If the plaintiff&#8217;s cause of action is not liquidated, and the plaintiff ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear in person, or by agent or attorney, the justice shall proceed to hear his allegations and proofs, and shall determine the cause, as shall appear from the testimony to be right; and if it shall appear from such testi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mony that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judgment shall be ren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered by default against the defendant, for such amount as the testi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mony shows the plaintiff to be entitled to, with costs; but if it do not appear that the plaintiff ought to recover, judgment shall be given for the defendant against the plaintiff for costs. 3. If the plaintiff fail to appear at or before ten o&#8217;clock A. M., of the return day of the citation, or at or before the same hour of any day to which the cause may have been continued, except in the case hereinbefore provided, the justice may render judgment of non-suit against the plaintiff, with costs. Every justice of the peace shall have power, upon good cause shown, supported by affidavit, to set aside a judgment by default, or by non-suit, at any time within ten days after the same was rendered; provided, that one day&#8217;s notice of such application shall be given to the opposite party, his agent or attorney, by the party applying, and in such cases the suit shall be continued to the next term of such justice&#8217;s court; and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, further, that all motions, where notice is required to the opposite party, shall be filed with the justice of the peace in writing. In all cases where a suit shall be brought before a justice of the peace for the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />covery of specific articles, on the trial thereof, the jury or justice, as the case may be, shall, if they find for the plaintiff, assess the value of such articles separately; and if the plaintiff recover, judgment shall be ren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered for the specific article or articles, if to be had, but if not, then for their value; and the justice shall issue thereon his writ, directed to some lawful officer, commanding him to put the plaintiff in the possession of the article or articles so recovered, if to be found, but if not, then to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed and make the value of such article or articles, with the legal interest from the date of judgment and costs, as under execution; and every justice shall, from time to time, when required by a party having a judgment in his court, issue such executions or other writs, as may be necessary to enforce such judgment, until the same shall have been sat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />isfied. No justice shall render a judgment upon any attachment or sequestration, unless the defendant shall have been cited either per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonally or by publication.666</p>

<p>Sec. 10. All judgments hereafter rendered by any justice of the peace, shall operate as a lien upon all the real estate of the defendant situated in the county where such judgment shall have been rendered, whenever a certified copy of such judgment shall be filed for registration in the office of the clerk of the District Court of such county; and it shall be the duty of such clerk to record all certified copies of such judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments as may be filed with him for registration, at the earliest practi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cable period, in the book used in said office for the record of mortgages, and to cause a regular and alphabetical index to be made of the names of plaintiffs and defendants in said judgments, and also a reference to the page on which such judgment is recorded.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. That any party, his agent or attorney, may appeal from any final judgment in any civil cause, rendered by any justice of the peace to the District Court of the county in which such final judgment shall have been rendered, upon notice thereof being given in open court; pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided, he shall, within ten days after the rendition of such judgment, file with such justice a bond, with one or more good and sufficient sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, in a sum equal to at least double the amount of such judgment, in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest and costs, payable to the appellee, conditioned that the party appealing shall prosecute his appeal to effect, or shall pay and satisfy the judgment or decree that may be rendered by the obligors in such bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. That in all cases where an appeal shall be taken from a jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice&#8217;s court to the District Court, it shall be the duty of the justice, from whom such appeal shall be taken, immediately to make out a transcript of all the entries made on his docket in such case, and file the same, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether with all the original papers of the cause, with the clerk of the District Court, on or before the first day of the term of such court next after such appeal was taken; but if it is not time for such transcript and papers to be filed at such first term, then they shall be so filed at the next succeeding term of said court, All causes appealed from a justice&#8217;s court shall be tried de novo, and such trial shall be final, without appeal to the Supreme Court. And on the call of the appearance docket by the district judge, if no appearance is entered on the docket for the defend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ant in the original suit, a judgment final by default shall be entered against him; and if the demand is liquidated and proven by any in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />strument in writing, the clerk shall assess damages to the plaintiff; otherwise, then the damages shall be assessed by a jury; and if the judgment upon such appeal in the District Court shall be the same, or for a greater amount than the judgment appealed from, the court shall add ten per cent. damages against the party appealing and the obligors on his appeal bond. A justice of the peace may grant a<pb n="273" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="99" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>stay of execution on any judgment for money, rendered by himself on a civil suit, for three months; provided, the person against whom such judgment was rendered shall, with one or more good and sufficient sure<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties, to be approved by such justice, appear before him and acknowledge themselves, and each of them, bound to the successful party in such sum as shall secure the amount of the judgment, interest and costs; which acknowledgment shall be entered by the justice on his docket, and shall have the force and effect of a judgment against the person making the acknowledgment; upon which execution shall issue for the amount of the original judgment, interest and costs, in case the same shall not be paid on or before the expiration of such stay; provided, however, that no such stay shall be granted unless the same is applied for within ten days after the entry of the original judgment. All executions issued by a justice of the peace shall be directed to some lawful officer of the State, and shall be returnable to his court in sixty days. It shall be the duty of the officer to whom any such execution is directed to execute and return the same on or before the return day thereof; and all the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions of the laws regulating executions from the District Courts, where the same are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, shall apply to and govern executions from justices of the peace, so far as the same are practicable. Hereafter no justice of the peace shall issue an execution in any case where the judgment may be for money, except in prosecu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions for criminal offenses and for costs, before the eleventh day after the day on which judgment was rendered, unless the party in whose favor judgment was given shall have filed an affidavit with the justice setting forth that he believes the party against whom the judgment was rendered will, within ten days, sell or otherwise dispose of or remove his, her or their property out of the county; whereupon it shall be the duty of said justice to issue an execution forthwith. Upon service of any certiorari being made on a justice of the peace, he shall make out a certified copy of the entries in the cause on his docket and transmit the same, with the original papers, to the District Court on or before the first day of the term next thereafter, and the case may be reviewed and tried de novo; and if the judgment be affirmed, ten per cent. damages shall be added, and judgment rendered against all the obligors in such bond. When a stay of execution upon any judgment rendered in the justice&#8217;s court is taken, the same shall not prevent the taking of a writ of certiorari, but the defendant shall have the right to take out his writ of certiorari to the justice&#8217;s court at any time within ninety days from the decision of the cause by the justice of the peace. Every person who shall have a cause of action against another within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, who shall<pb n="274" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="100" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>make oath in writing before such justice, that he is too poor to pay the fees of such action, shall be entitled to all process necessary for the trial of such action, and to have a trial thereof free of costs. No suit shall be brought before any justice of the peace where he may be interested or where he may be related to either the plaintiff or de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity, but in all such cases suit shall be brought before the nearest justice not so interest<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed or related, and in all cases pending before any justice where he is thus disqualified from sitting in the case, any justice in the county may sit and try the same.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. Each justice of the peace shall hold a term of his court once in each month, and may transact such business out of said term as is au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorized by law; and the justices of the peace who reside at the county seats shall hold their courts on the first Monday in each month, and the other justices shall hold their courts at such time as may be prescribed by the Police Courts, and such justices may hold their courts from day to day until all business shall be disposed of. Should the office of justice of the peace within any county of the State of Texas become vacant by death, resignation or otherwise, it shall be lawful for any justice of the peace within such county to proceed to try and dispose of all such un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />finished business as may be on the docket of such justice who may have vacated his office as aforesaid, until a successor shall have been elected and qualified. If from sickness or absence from the county any jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice of the peace shall fail to hold a regular term of his court, then and in that case any other justice of the peace within the same county shall be, and he is hereby authorized to preside in the place and stead of such sick or absent justice, and to discharge, perform and transact all such business as may be necessary during such absence. If from any cause whatever the regular term of a justice&#8217;s court should not be held at the time fixed by law, the business pending on the justice&#8217;s docket shall stand continued until the next regular term thereof, and all business not disposed of at a regular term of such court shall likewise stand contin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ued until the next regular term thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. Justices of the peace have the same power, in cases within their jurisdiction, as clerks of the District Court, to issue writs of at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tachment, sequestration and garnishments, and all laws regulating such writs in the District Court shall be held applicable to justices&#8217; courts. Whenever any sheriff or other lawful officer shall levy a writ of execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, sequestration or attachment upon any personal property, and such property, or any part thereof, shall be claimed by any person who is not a party to such writ, such person or his agent may make oath in writing, before some justice of the<pb n="275" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="101" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>peace of the county where the levy was made, that such claim is made in good faith, and present such oath, in writing, to the officer who made such levy, and may also execute and deliver to the officer who made such levy, his bond, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved of by such officer, payable to the plaintiff in such writ, for an amount equal to double the value of the property so claimed, to be as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessed by such officer, conditioned that the party making such claim, in case he fails to establish his right to such property, shall return the same to the officer making such levy, or his successor, and shall also pay to the plaintiff in such writ all damages that may be awarded against him by the jury on the trial of the right to such property; whereupon it shall be the duty of the officer receiving such oath and bond to deliver such property so claimed to the person so claiming it. Whenever any person shall claim property, and shall make the oath, and give the bond as provided for in the first section of this act, if the writ under which said levy was made was issued by any justice of the peace or court of the county where such levy was made, the sheriff or other officer receiving such oath and bond shall endorse on the writ that such claim has been made, and oath and bond given, stating by whom, and shall also endorse on such bond the value of the property, as assessed by himself, and shall forthwith re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turn such bond and oath to the justice or clerk of the court from which the said writ issued; but if the writ under which such levy was made was issued by any justice of the peace or court of another county than that in which such levy was made, then the sheriff or other officer receiving such oath and bond shall endorse on such bond the value of the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, as assessed by himself, and shall forthwith return such bond and oath, with a copy of the writ, to some justice of the peace of his county, if the writ was issued by a justice, or to the District Court of his county, if the writ was issued by any other authority than a justice of the peace; and he shall also endorse on the writ that such claim has been made, and oath and bond given, stating by whom, and to what justice or court the bond has been returned, and at what time it was so returned; and shall forthwith return such writ to the justice or court from which it issued. Whenever any oath and bond for the trial of the right of property shall be returned, under the provisions of this act, to any justice of the peace, the plaintiff in the writ may, at any time, apply to such justice for a citation against such claimant, and on the return thereof executed, a trial of the right to such property shall be had before such justice, in like man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner as other trials are had before justices of the peace; but if the property was taken from the possession of the claimant, the burden of proof shall be on the plaintiff; and if it was taken from the pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" /><pb n="276" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="102" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>session of the defendant in such writ, or any other person than the claimant, the burden of proof shall be on the claimant. In all trials of the right of property, under the provisions of this act, in any county other than that in which the writ issued under which the levy was made, the copy of the writ required to be returned by the sheriff or other offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cer making the levy, shall be received in evidence, in like manner as the original could be. In all cases when any claimant of property, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der the provisions of this act, shall fail to establish his right thereto, and judgment shall be rendered against him, if he shall fail to return such property in as good condition, as when he received it, to the officer from whose possession he received it, or his successor, within ten days after the rendition of such judgment, such officer, or his successor, shall certify such failure to the court or justice by which such judgment was rendered; whereupon it shall be the duty of the justice or clerk having the custody of such bond, to endorse thereon that it has been forfeited, when such bond shall have the force and effect of a judgment against all the obligors for the value of such property, with legal interest thereon from its date, upon which execution may issue as on other judgments. A claim made to property under the provisions of this act shall operate as a release, by the claimant, of all damages against the sheriff or other officer who levied on such property. Proceedings for the trial of the right of property, under the provisions of this act, shall in no case pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vent the plaintiff in the writ from having a levy made upon other prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty of the defendant than that levied on and claimed, if it can be found. The plaintiff in any civil suit, before process issues, or at any time before final judgment, upon motion of the defendant or any officer of the court interested in the costs accruing in such suit, may be ruled to give secur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity for the costs; and if such rule be entered against the plaintiff, and he fail to comply therewith on or before the first day of the next term of the court, the suit shall be dismissed. All bonds given as security for costs shall have the force and effect of judgments against all the obligors for the said costs. Executors and administrators of deceased persons&#8217; estates and guardians shall not be ruled to give security for costs in any suit to recover money due or property belonging to the estate; and no security shall be exacted of executors or administrators of deceased persons&#8217; estates in appeals taken in suing for such money or property, or in defending suits brought against such estates for money or property. Justices of the peace shall keep a fee-book, in which shall be taxed all costs accruing in any suit, whether civil or criminal.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. When any rent shall become due, or the tenant about to remove from any rented premises, or remove his property from<pb n="277" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="103" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>such rented premises, it shall be lawful for the person to whom the rent is payable, his agent, attorney or assigns, to apply to any justice of the peace in the county where the premises are situated, for a distress war<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rant to seize the property of such tenant; provided, such plaintiff, his agent or attorney shall make oath that the amount sued for is for rent, or shall produce a writing from such tenant to that effect; and it shall be the duty of such justice to issue his warrant of distress to the proper officer, commanding him to seize the property of the defendant, or so much thereof as will satisfy the demand; which warrant snail be, if the sum is not more than one hundred dollars, returnable to said justice, or to some justice of the county; but if more than one hundred dollars, the warrant shall be returnable to the District Court; in which case it shall be the duty of the justice to transmit all the papers of said cause to the District Court, on or before the first day of the next term thereof. Upon the return of the distress warrant, or before the justice of the peace, if he shall have jurisdiction to try the same, shall issue a citation to the defendant, and the same shall proceed to trial as in ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nary suits. It shall be the duty of the officer to whom such warrant is direpted, to seize the property of such tenant, or so much thereof as shall be of value sufficient to satisfy such debt and cost, and the same in his possession safely keep (unless the defendant will replevy the same,) and make due return thereof to the court in which such warrant is return<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able, at the next term thereof; provided, that if the property is of a perishable or wasting kind, the sheriff or other officer, or the plaintiff or the defendant, may apply to the justice issuing the warrant for an order to sell such property.

<salute>All Act prescribing the mode of proceeding in District Courts in matters of probate.</salute>
</opener>
<div4 type="section">
<head type="main">The Probate Jurisdiction of the District Courts.</head>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the District Courts shall have the following jurisdiction in matters of probate:</p>
<p>1. To take probate of wills, and grant letters testamentary; appoint administrators and grant letters of administrations on estates of de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased persons; transact business appertaining to the estates of deceased persons; settle the accounts of executors and administrators; and par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tition and distribute said estates.</p>
<p>2. To appoint guardians of the persons and estates of minors, per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons of unsound mind, and habitual drunkards; transact business ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pertaining to such estates; and settle the accounts of such guardians.</p>
<p>Which jurisdiction must be exercised in the manner prescribed by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The term &#8220;persons of unsound mind,&#8221; when used in this code, includes idiots, lunatics and insane persons.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. A habitual drunkard is one whose mind has become so im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />paired, by the use of intoxicating liquors, or drugs, that he is incapable of taking care of himself or his property.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. Where the District Court has jurisdiction, its process may run to and be executed in any county in the State.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="section">
<head type="main">General Provisions relating to matters of Probate.</head>
<p>Sec. 5. The mode of proceeding in the District Courts in matters of probate is by special proceedings.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. A special proceeding in the District Court is commenced by written application.</p>
<pb n="316" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="142" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 7. There are only two kinds of special proceedings in the District Courts in matters of probate:</p>
<p>1. Administration.</p>
<p>2. Guardianship.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The foundation of every proceeding is the citation, which is required to be served by posting, by personal service, or by publication; and without such citation, in the manner in which each party is entitled to be served, the proceeding is void as to any party who had not legal notice. But where a party is served in the manner in which service on him is required to be made, the proceeding can be, as to such party, at most erroneous, and cannot be attacked as null.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. All citations returned served, shall therefore be recorded, with the return thereon, and such record shall be evidence.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. The citation from the court in matters of probate, instead of being accompanied by a copy of the application, contains a brief state<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the nature thereof and by whom made.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. All reports, returns or exhibits, required to be made by execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors, administrators, guardians or trustees, must be in writing, supported by affidavit.</p>
<p>Sec. 12. Every order of court must be entered of record, and any sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed order, not entered of record, is a nullity.</p>
<p>Sec. 13. No order can be made otherwise than at a regular term, in open court, after citation, unless the contrary be expressly stated by the law which provides for such order, except, orders the object of which is to expedite the proceedings, or preserve the property of an estate, infant or person of unsound mind; any such order may be made in vacation with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out notice.</p>
<p>Sec. 14. When citation is required to be posted, it means for ten days, at three of the most public places in the county, one of which shall be the court-house door, and no two of which shall be within the same city or town, to all persons interested, unless the contrary be expressed by the law which provides for such, citation. When a citation or notice is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired to be posted, the clerk of the court shall place the original cita<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion or notice, in the hands of any sheriff or constable, who shall post copies thereof, and shall return the original, showing how he has posted the same. The posting may be done by any person not an officer, who shall, with the original citation, or notice, or affidavit, show how he has posted the same. When a citation or notice is required to be published, the original shall be placed in the hands of the sheriff, who shall furnish a copy thereof to the publisher, and shall return the original, showing how the same has been published.</p>
<p>Sec. 15. The county of Galveston shall be an exception to any<pb n="317" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="143" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>provision which requires the public places, at which a notice shall be posted, to be not within the same city or town.</p>
<p>Sec. 16. When a party is required to be cited, it means that he shall be cited in the same manner which is provided in like cases for the service of citation in the District Courts in civil cases; except that where per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonal service is required, it shall, in all cases, be made ten days before the time at which the party is to appear, unless the court or judge, in vacation, otherwise direct by previous order. Where service of citation is not completed before a term of the court, the party cited is, neverthe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less, required to appear at the expiration of the term required for service.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. Where citation, or being cited, is spoken of, it means served as provided in the preceding section. When service by posting or publi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cation is meant, it is expressly so stated.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The court shall exercise the same power as in civil cases, in the appointment of special guardians, and an attorney to represent absent parties, who have not been personally served.</p>
<p>Sec. 19. The mode of proceeding in the District Courts, as established by law, applies to proceedings in matters of probate, in all cases where they are, in their nature, applicable.</p>
<p>Sec. 20. There is no trial by jury in matters of probate, except when, expressly provided by law.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. When the term court or judge is used in this act, it means the District Court of the county where the proceeding is pending, and the judge of such court, unless it be otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Sec. 22. When the word &#8220;file&#8221; or &#8220;filed&#8221; is used in this act, it means in the District Court where the proceeding is pending, unless a different meaning be expressed.</p>
<p>Sec. 23. The term executor includes executrix; administrator includes administratrix; the singular includes the plural, the plural the singular; the male the female; a party includes any number, whether jointly or severally interested; the present and past tense include the future; and the future includes the past. If the general rules here stated conflict with any special provisions, they must yield to it.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="section">
<head type="main">Of the settlement and distribution of the estates of deceased persons&#8212; Preliminary provisions.</head>
<p>Sec. 24. The proceeding to settle and distribute the estate of a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceased person, is called administration.</p>
<p>Sec. 25. The term estate of a deceased person, includes all the rights and obligations of the deceased, as they existed at the time of<pb n="318" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="144" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>his decease, together with all that has accrued thereto since, and the new charges to which it becomes subject.</p>
<p>Sec. 26. The property reserved from forced sale by the Constitution and laws of this State, or its value, if there be no such property, does not form any part of the estate of a deceased person, where a constituent of the family survives.</p>
<p>Sec. 27. When a person dies, the estate vests in the persons entitled under the law regulating wills and the descent and distribution of es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tates; but, upon the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, the executor or administrator becomes entitled to the possession of it, for the purpose of administration, and for that purpose only.</p>
<p>Sec. 28. No absence for any length of time, without being heard from, will authorize an administration to be commenced on the estate of such absentee.</p>
<p>Sec. 29. The object of administration is:</p>
<p>1. To apply as much of the estate as may be necessary to the payment of the debts of the deceased.</p>
<p>2. To distribute the estate, or the balance after the payment of debts, to the persons entitled to receive it.</p>
<p>3. To preserve the estate; and if there be no creditors, or if after the payment of creditors, there be no person present in person or by attorney, who is entitled to receive it, to preserve it until such persons appear.</p>
<p>Sec. 30. It follows from the preceding section, that if the persons en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titled to receive the estate be present, and can agree as to the distribution thereof, and there be no creditors, there is no necessity for administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion.</p>
<p>Sec. 31. Incidental to administration is the recovery of the possession of the property, and partition between the estate and other part owners.</p>
<p>Sec. 32. Administration is effected by aid of&#8212;</p>
<p>1. An executor appointed by the last will of the deceased and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />firmed by the court.</p>
<p>2. An administrator appointed by the court on application therefor.</p>
<p>Sec. 33. Where the wife dies, her husband surviving, adminis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tration is unnecessary, except as to any separate estate which may have belonged to her. The husband continues to have the same power of disposition over the community property which he possessed during the continuance of marriage. But he shall be required to return an inventory and appraisement of all such property, and to file a bond, signed by one or more sureties, to be approved by and pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able to the district clerk of the county, in an amount equal to the value<pb n="319" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="145" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>of the whole of the community property, to the effect that he will faith<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully administer the same and pay over one-half of the surplus after the payment of the debts with which the whole is properly chargeable, to such person or persons as shall be entitled to receive it.</p>
<p>Sec. 34. The husband, in such case, is liable to be called to account at any time after one year from the date of the bond.</p>
<p>Sec. 35. Such bond, is suable, recoverable, and in every other respect the same as the bond of an administrator.</p>
<p>Sec. 36. The surviving wife may retain the exclusive management and control of the community property of herself and her deceased husband, in the same manner, and subject to the same rights, rules and regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions as provided in the three preceding sections, until she may marry again; but, upon a second marriage, she shall cease to have such control and management of said estate, or the right to dispose of the same, under section thirty-three, and said estate shall be subject to administration as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 37. Where the husband or wife dies intestate, leaving no child, or children, and no separate estate, the common property passes to the survivor, charged with the debts of the community, and no administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion is required.</p>
<p>Sec. 38. The distributees only of an estate are said to be &#8220;interested in the estate;&#8221; the distributees, creditors and the executor or administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tor. are said to be &#8220;interested in the administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec. 39. A distributee of an estate is one who is entitled to receive the whole or a part thereof, after the payment of the debts and compli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance with all other obligations not created by will. The term distributee includes legatees and devisees.</p>
<p>Sec. 40. The order of court confirming the appointment of the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ecutor, and the entry made, during term or in vacation, of the fact that such executor has given bond and taken the oath, are called granting letters testamentary.</p>
<p>Sec. 41. The order of court that such a person shall receive letters of administration on giving bond and taking the oath, and the entry made, during term or in vacation, of the fact that bond has been filed and oath taken, are called granting letters of administration.</p>
<p>Sec. 42. When anything is prescribed with reference to &#8220;the original grant of letters testamentary or of administration,&#8221; it refers to the time when an executor or administrator of the estate first gave bond and took the oath.

<pb n="403" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="229" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>
<p>Sec. 104. If, for want of bidders, any personal property cannot be sold, the same shall be bid in by the sheriff for the State, and a certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate of purchase issued therefor; and such property, so bid in, may be sold at any time thereafter as the Comptroller of Public Accounts may direct, and no property so sold shall be subject to redemption.

<p>Sec. 106. If, from any cause, the sale of property seized for taxes shall not take place at the time first appointed, the sheriff shall appoint some other time, give the like notice, and proceed to sell such property in the manner prescribed in the first instance in this act.</p>

<p>Sec. 110. If any person, after the return of any tax is made by him and is still due and unpaid, or any person subject to an occupation tax which is still due and unpaid, shall attempt to remove any property out of the county where the same was rendered, or is liable to tax, without the prepayment of all taxes due by such person, it is hereby made the duty of the sheriff forthwith to distrain upon a sufficiency thereof as will satisfy the taxes, penalties and cost which may be due, and sell the same in the manner heretofore directed in other cases.</p>

A list of such payments shall be transmitted by said Comptroller, immediately after the first day of April, to the sheriffs of the counties wherein such lands may be situated, who shall make the proper entry thereof, and be al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowed a credit therefor in their settlement with the Comptroller.</p>
<p>Sec. 112. No deed of trust, or mortgage upon goods or chattels, shall prevent the same from being distrained and sold for taxes assessed against the grantor of such deed, while such goods or chattels remain in such grantor&#8217;s possession; nor shall any such deed prevent the goods and chat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tels conveyed from being distrained and sold for taxes assessed thereon, no matter in whose possession they may be found.</p>
<p>Sec. 113. The sheriff shall, after the close of the annual sales in his county, make out a list of those persons who have failed to pay their taxes, and who are not possessed of any property upon which to levy to secure their payment; and upon said list being sworn to before a justice of the peace or notary public, that he has made due search and has been unable to find any property upon which to levy, the County Court shall allow him credit for the amount of county taxes due thereon, and shall certify that fact upon said list; and it shall be the duty of the Comptroller of Public Accounts, upon presentation of such list so certified to, to allow him credit for the amount of State taxes due thereon, in his annual set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tlement of accounts.</p>
